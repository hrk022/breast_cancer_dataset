Project: Logistic Regression Evaluation and Threshold Tuning

Description:
------------
This project demonstrates how to evaluate a Logistic Regression model using various metrics 
such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. It also includes tuning the 
classification threshold to analyze the trade-offs between precision and recall, with a 
visual plot to help decide the best threshold.

Files:
------
- logistic_regression_evaluation.ipynb (or .py): Contains the code for training the model, 
  making predictions, evaluating performance metrics, and tuning the threshold.
- requirements.txt: Lists necessary Python packages (e.g., scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy).

How to Use:
-----------
1. Prepare your dataset and split into features (X) and target (y).
2. Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
3. Obtain predicted probabilities for the positive class using `model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]`.
4. Use the provided code snippets to:
    - Generate confusion matrix and calculate precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
    - Plot precision and recall as functions of different classification thresholds.
5. Analyze the plots and metrics to choose an optimal threshold based on your use case.

Key Concepts:
-------------
- Logistic Regression outputs probabilities via the sigmoid function.
- The default threshold is 0.5, but this can be adjusted to balance between precision and recall.
- Precision vs Recall curve helps to find the best threshold according to the problem's needs.
- ROC-AUC provides an overall measure of the model's ability to discriminate classes.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn (optional, for visualization)

Example Usage Snippet:
----------------------
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, precision_score, recall_score, roc_auc_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
